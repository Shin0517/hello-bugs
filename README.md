# 🧠 A LeetCode Journey – brute force ➡️ brain force

Welcome to my late-night `debug()` sessions. This repo documents my quest to become a better problem solver.
I’m solving problems, writing readable code, and committing like a responsible adult👤

Learning is better when...
- Progress is **tracked**   
- Solutions can be **reused**
###### Also because GitHub green squares are addictive...💦


## 🛠️ What's Inside

- 🧩 LeetCode problems
- ❓ My solutions
- 📁 Folder names are clean and commit messages are *semi-readable* (thanks to a mini tool I wrote)
- 📚 `README.md` files with explanations or breakdowns


## 🙏 Credits & Inspiration

This idea and structure is inspired by [@1chooo](https://github.com/1chooo), 
whose clean repo setup and approach gave me the nudge to start organizing my own work more seriously.
